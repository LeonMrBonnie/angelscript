# AngelScript

AngelScript build used by the [alt:V AngelScript module](https://github.com/LeonMrBonnie/altv-angelscript-module).

## Changes

This repository only contains the needed part for the AngelScript build, e.g. docs and unneeded project setups were removed.

## Disclaimer

This repository contains code that is *not* mine. I simply created this repository for some clean CI and easier management of the AngelScript
version used in my module. It might also contain code that is different to the original AngelScript source code.

AngelScript is written and maintained by Andreas JÃ¶nsson and I thank him for his work on this language.
